Thinking through the design of the hierarchy...

I want to do 5 layers of 3.

Each layer is given...

- A title
- A beginning state
- An end state

It should generate...

- Three sections names
- Each with a beginning state and an end state.

The leaf notes should generate...

- Prose that connects the beginning state to the end state.

<section>
  <title>
</section>

- Generate a title and summary of the book.
- Generate three sub-titles and sub-titles.
- Recurse until you hit 5 layers deep.
